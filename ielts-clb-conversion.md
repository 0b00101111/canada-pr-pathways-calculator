- Reading: 8.0 = **CLB 9**
- Writing: 7.5 = **CLB 9**

## The Discrepancy Explained

### Correct CRS Calculation:
1. **Core/Human Capital**: 305 points ✓
2. **Spouse Factors**: 20 points ✓
3. **Skill Transferability**: 
   - Education + Language: Should be **50 points** (Bachelor's + CLB 9+ in all abilities)
   - Foreign Work + Language: 50 points ✓
   - Total: 100 points (but calculator shows 75)
4. **Additional**: 0 points ✓

**Total Should Be: 425 points**

## The Bug in Official Calculator or Data Entry

The official IRCC calculator is giving you only 25 points for Education + Language transferability, which happens when:
- You have CLB 7 or 8 in at least one ability
- But ALL your abilities are CLB 9+

## Possible Explanations:

1. **Data Entry Issue**: The ranges you entered (7.5-9.0) might be interpreted by the system as the lower bound only
2. **System Bug**: The official calculator might have an issue with PTE Core score conversion
3. **Conservative Interpretation**: The system might be using the most conservative interpretation of score ranges

## Recommendation:

If you have your exact IELTS scores (not ranges), try entering them more precisely. For example:
- If Speaking is exactly 7.5, that's CLB 9
- If it's 8.0 or higher, that's CLB 10

The discrepancy of 25 points is entirely in the Education + Language transferability calculation.
